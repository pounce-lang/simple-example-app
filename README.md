# A Simple Example Application for the Pounce Programming Language
This is a starter kit that will let you start using the Pounce programming language, embedded in a web page. 
It uses the Pounce parser and interpretor from the npm package @pounce-lang/core.

## Pounce is a Concatinative Language
More information on "What Pounce is?" can be (coming soon) found at pounce-lang.org/about, but in short: Pounce is a "concatenative" languages (as opposed to "applicative"). Concatenative referes to stringing (or concatinating) together functions, composing them in to your over all program.  Pounce is also functional, post-fix and stack-based, but don't let that scare you. It may be the easiest language you will ever learn. The chalange will be letting go of your preconceived notions of what a programming language should look like and how to go about programming. Try one of the tutorials (coming soon) at pounce-lang.org/tutorials.
